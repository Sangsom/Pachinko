# Pachinko

App is created by following Hacking by Swift book by Paul Hudson.

As an challenge exercises I've implemented following features:

- Creating a random ball color each time user taps the screen.
- Forcing Y value of new balls so that they are falling of the top of sceen.
- Limiting players to have 5 balls simultaneously and removing obstacle boxes when they are hit. Also giving an extra ball when green slot has been hit with ball.
